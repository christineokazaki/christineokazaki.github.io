  <h1>the typewriter</h1>
  <article>
    <p>It is hard to say with certainty where typewriters will be in the far future.
      Following the trends of today, they are most likely to remain collectibles and
      rise in price as they become older and more rare. This could also lead to
      them potentially being featured in more museums and gaining prominence as
      antiques. </p>

      <blockquote><p>Typing on an <em>actual typewriter</em>
        on paper is only a <em>softer version</em> of <em>chiseling words</em> into stone. --<strong>tom hanks</strong>

  <h1>4 future</h1>
  <article><p>
    Since modern technology puts emphasis on devices featuring many abilities while
    still sporting a slim and lightweight exterior, it is unlikely that typewriters
    will become widely manufactured again. With the absence of a market for them,
    it would not be logical to mass produce something that is pricey and inconvenient.
    This is not to say that typewriter enthusiasts should feel discouraged; there is
    still a passionate -- albeit small -- community maintaining their own collections
    and supporting modest companies that still produce typewriters for sale (<a href="http://www.vice.com/read/people-are-still-using-typewriters-you-just-stopped-paying-attention-313">Millard</a>). If
    these typewriter fanatics exist in a world where slim, powerful devices are
    favored, it might be safe to assume that they will still be present in years
    to come. Though technology may always be advancing, this will only cause people
    to cherish typewriters even more.
