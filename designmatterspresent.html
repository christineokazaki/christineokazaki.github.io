    <p>Today, typewriters have been largely replaced by computers, laptops, and
      tablets. The convenience and efficiency of these devices are ultimately
      much greater than a machine whose last upgrades were made in the 1900s.
      Nonetheless, this does not mean that typewriters have completely disappeared;
      rather, they have become collectors items, with a particular resurgence in
      recent years. </p>

    Some areas are more reliant on typewriters than others. In India, for example,
    some people still sit on the street and type out documents for others in exchange
    for a small fee, and this exists as their occupation. Though their last typewriter
    manufacturing site was closed down in 2011, this has not stopped these men from
    sitting outside of government buildings and typing up wills, deeds, and applications
    in order to make a living. Many of their clients come to them with illegible notes,
    which the typists are easily able to decipher -- this being their advantage to
    what they refer to as “computer people” -- and turn into a cleanly typed sheet
    of paper (<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/06/160619091903095.html">Tarafdar</a>).
    Furthermore, the NYPD only started to phase out typewriters at the end of 2015 (<a href="http://www.vice.com/read/people-are-still-using-typewriters-you-just-stopped-paying-attention-313">Millard</a>)</br></br>


    As they are no longer mass produced, typewriters are rare in American households
    these days; despite this, they are fairly accessible and available for purchase
    through the Internet. Though they are not as practical as an easily portable
    laptop or tablet, there are several advantages to typewriters. Without internet
    access or external abilities, it minimizes distractions and presents a challenge
    to the user, not only to stay focused but also to think carefully about their
    words, since you cannot erase. Furthermore, they offer more privacy and many
    do not require electricity -- which is why they are more popular in countries
    like India and Latin America (<a href="http://www.vice.com/read/people-are-still-using-typewriters-you-just-stopped-paying-attention-313">Millard</a>).
    Some also prefer typewriters for their sentimental ttachments, and the sensory
    feedback and deeper connection that they provide; beyond this, others might
    simply appreciate the retro, vintage aesthetic that seems to be making a comeback recently.
