  <h1>the typewriter</h1>
  <article>
    <p>Among the many assertions of who was responsible for creating the first
      typewriter, Englishman Henry Mill was one of the first. Not yet titled
      “typewriter” but rather “Machine for Transcribing Letters”, his patent
      -- dated in 1714 -- described a device that was intended to transcribe
      letters permanently and neatly, and therefore might be “of great use in
      settlements and publick records”. It is believed that over one hundred
      prototypes were created from inventors ranging from countries such as Italy
      to Denmark. However, there is no arguing the fact that Christopher Latham
      Sholes was the first to assemble a successful typewriter (<a href="http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/keyboard.html">
        "Computer Keyboard")</a>.

<blockquote><p>... an <em>artificial machine</em> or method for impressing or <em>transcribing of
  letters</em>, one after another, as in writing, whereby all writing whatsoever
  may be <em>engrossed in paper</em> or parchment so neat and exact as not to be
  <em>distinguished from print</em>; that the said machine or method may be of great
  use in <em>settlements</em> and <em>publick records</em>, the impression being <em>deeper and more
  lasting</em> than any other writing, and <em>not to be erased</em> or counterfeited without
  manifest discovery. -- <strong>henry mill's patent</strong> </blockquote> </p>

  <h1>2 past</h1>
  <article><p>
    Influenced by the earlier prototypes of his day, Sholes collaborated with a
    few of his friends -- Carlos Glidden and Samuel Soule -- to invent the typewriter
    in 1867. This model remains on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of
    American History. Despite Sholes’s attempts to constantly change and refine
    his product over the next several years, he was having difficulty selling
    it on his own. Finally, he sold his patents for $12,000 to two entrepreneurs,
    James Densmore and George Yost, who were able to persuade a manufacturing
    company in New York. This company, titled E. Remington and Sons, began to
    mass produce typewriters along with their “fire arms, sewing machines and
    farm machinery” (<a href="http://www.mytypewriter.com/explorelearn/index.html">“Typewriter History”</a>) in 1873. </br></br>

    Officially released in 1874, Remington titled the first model the Sholes and
    Gliden Type-Writer. Two mechanics from the sewing machine division at the
    company took on the task of engineering it; mostly made out of wood, it
    included a foot-pedal for the carriage return, and flowery details for
    decoration (<a href="http://www.mytypewriter.com/explorelearn/index.html">“Typewriter History”</a>). It introduced the QWERTY keyboard,
    which was adapted so that the “mechanical rods attached to the keys would
    [not] stick to each other” when people typed too quickly (<a href="http://gizmodo.com/why-we-still-use-qwerty-keyboards-even-though-theyre-a-1643855077">D’Cruz</a>). The
    mechanics of the machine, however, did not allow for the typist to see what
    they were writing. Similar to many first models of other inventions, it
    suffered from other imperfections in the engineering and required many adjustments.</br></br>


    Mechanical issues were not the only reason that typewriters struggled to be
    accepted. Not only was the price high for a floundering economy, but many
    believed that they would be impractical or that typing appeared impersonal
    to customers. After further adjusting the machine and adding the shift key
    for both lower and uppercase letters, the second model of the Remington took
    off within the next decade. The era of industrialization and the discovery of
    employees who were in need of a way to efficiently record accounts and send
    correspondence helped boost its popularity (<a href="http://www.mytypewriter.com/explorelearn/index.html">“Typewriter History”</a>).</br></br>

    Soon after its release, the second model was adjusted so that individuals
    did not have to manually lift the platen to see their content
    (<a href="http://www.mytypewriter.com/explorelearn/index.html">“Typewriter History”</a>). This was a major upgrade and allowed for even
    greater convenience, further promoting the typewriter at a time where
    everyone believed it could not possibly improved any more. Of course,
    as the years continued, small adjustments were made, many of them stylistic;
    as typewriters began creeping into households, companies started designing
    machines that were sleeker and more colorful. The 1930s jump started a movement
    of not only marketing towards housewives and children, but also marked the year
    that portable and electrical versions were introduced (<a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/48912/brief-history-typewriter">Dugan</a>).</br></br>


    Throughout the 1940s until the 1960s, typewriters remained the “main means of
    data entry”; however, it faced heavy competition as personal computers started
    emerging and competing (<a href="http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/keyboard.html">
      "Computer Keyboard"</a>). Even the IBM Selectric, which
    eliminated the issue of typewriter jams, could no longer compete with the
    efficiency of the challenger. Although it was slowly phased out in favor of
    the computer, a fair percentage of the population today keep typewriters in
    their possession as keepsakes (<a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/typing-through-time-the-history-of-the-keyboard/#designone">“Typing Through Time: Keyboard History”</a>).</br>
