  <h1>the typewriter</h1>
  <article>
    <p>Invented over a century ago, the typewriter has a long history and has
      undoubtedly paved the way for much of the technology we use today. Responsible
      for the first keyboard and the QWERTY order that has maintained its status as
      the standard layout since the 1870s, it acts as an iconic model in the design
      world. Though it might not be as popular as it once was, it has certainly
      left its impact as a device that allows individuals to quickly record their
      thoughts, send correspondence, and so on. Typewriters were also favored by many
      famous authors, including Ernest Hemingway, Agatha Christie, and E.B. White.
      To this day, even well known actor Tom Hanks has a collection exceeding fifty
      typewriters.

  <h1>1 overview</h1>
  <article><p>
    There are many debates about who invented the first typewriter before it was
    commercially successful, due to various claims without drawings or other proof.
    The first effective prototype -- which currently sits at the Smithsonian
    Institution -- was invented by Christopher Latham Sholes in 1867.
    It did not create a stir in the market until several years after its release;
    however, soon enough, typewriters were in every workplace and household.
    They rode the wave of success throughout the early 1900s until the late sixties,
    when the efficiency and technological advancements of computers took their place.
    Today, typewriters mostly serve as a spark of nostalgia -- a reminder of both
    the aesthetics and inventions of the past. Nonetheless, it is an unforgettable
    device that has more than served its purpose and demonstrated how one design
    can hold influence beyond its years.
