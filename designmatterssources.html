    <p>Conradt, Stacey. "The Quick 10: 10 Authors and Their Typewriters." Mental Floss. N.p., 15 June 2009. Web. 07 Nov. 2016. http://mentalfloss.com/article/21979/quick-10-10-authors-and-their-typewriters.
	This is a list that briefly mentions ten authors who favored typewriters. Some descriptions include anecdotes and quotes, but all include what kind of model the author used.

Dalakov, George. "Computer Keyboard." History of Computers. Web. 24 Oct. 2016. http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/keyboard.html
               This is an article detailing the history of the computer keyboard. It starts out explaining the very first claims about who invented the first typewriter, then transitions into how computers adapted their keyboards from typewriters. The rest of the website examines other mechanical inventions, but fails to state their sources.

Dugan, Bryan. "A Brief History of the Typewriter." Mental Floss. 18 Feb. 2013. Web. 24 Oct. 2016. http://mentalfloss.com/article/48912/brief-history-typewriter
This article is, as its title implies, a short history of the typewriter. It opens up explaining how the typewriter finally gained popularity in the market, and continues the rest of the article with images that demonstrate the various types of models that were released. The images mostly show the author’s point that companies wanted to experiment with colors as they marked to different audiences. The article also links to external sources.

Feinberg, Ashley. "Why We Still Use QWERTY Keyboards (Even Though They're Awful)." Gizmodo. N.p., 08 Oct. 2014. Web. 07 Nov. 2016. http://gizmodo.com/why-we-still-use-qwerty-keyboards-even-though-theyre-a-1643855077
The author explains the reason behind why QWERTY remains the standard layout for English keyboards today, insisting that an ABCDEF keyboard would be much more logical and easier for people to learn. It includes several images of various keyboards, from QWERTY to the elusive Dvorak layout. I found the explanation behind the invention of the QWERTY layout useful.

    Millard, Drew. "Why Are People Still Using Typewriters in 2015?" VICE. 13 Mar. 2015. Web. 24 Oct. 2016. http://www.vice.com/read/people-are-still-using-typewriters-you-just-stopped-paying-attention-313.
    The author expands on why typewriters are still in use during a time where they seem old-fashioned. The article includes a bit of information on specific areas that still use typewriters today, and testimonies from individuals who are typewriter enthusiasts. The author does not indicate any bias towards or against typewriters, but merely introduces the side of those who support them.

    Tarafdar, Swati Sanyal. "Meet the Men Keeping the Typewriter Alive in India." News from Al Jazeera. 22 June 2016. Web. 24 Oct. 2016.
    http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/06/160619091903095.html. Published this past summer, this article reinforces that typewriters are still in use in different parts of the world. It explains that in India, men make a living off of typing up documents for people on typewriters. It contains interesting information and quotes from the men themselves about what they can offer with their services, how much they make, and the daily routine they perform in order to make a living.

    "Typewriter History." MyTypewriter.com. Web. 24 Oct. 2016. http://www.mytypewriter.com/explorelearn/index.html.
    A short page on a website that sells typewriters, this page explains the beginnings of the first commercially successful typewriter, and the adjustments that were made to the various models that were released.

    "Typing Through Time: Keyboard History." Das Keyboard Blog. N.p., 22 July 2011. Web. 07 Nov. 2016. http://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/typing-through-time-the-history-of-the-keyboard/#designone.
    The blog portion of this website offers a detailed history on typewriters, and how they were eventually pushed out by computers. The content is separated into three chapters on “the evolution of the typewriter”, “the development of the computer keyboard”, and “computer keyboard layouts”. Mainly looking at the section about the typewriter’s progression, I was able to find information I did not see on other websites, particularly about the IBM Selectric.

    "Typewriter Quotes." BrainyQuote. Xplore, n.d. Web. 07 Nov. 2016. http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/keywords/typewriter.html.
    This website offers many quotes about the subject you wish to find quotes on. I searched for quotes about typewriters and chose one from Ernest Hemingway.
