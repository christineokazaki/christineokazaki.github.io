    <h4>october 4 2016</h4>
     <p>I chose the website <a href="http://speakeasyburlesque.com">speakeasyburlesque.com</a>. The overall design is very aesthetically pleasing, and does a good job
       of invoking the old-fashioned feel that they are aiming for. The subtle animations and colors of the images also
       add to the atmosphere and make it fun to scroll the website. The opening video and the text on the home page make their
       purpose very clear, and the links on the side make the site intuitive and easy to navigate. </br>
      </br>
        <img src="images/speakeasy1.png"/>

            I would add a contact form directly on the website under the contact section, just to make it a little bit easier to get
      immediately in touch with them; this form could include various specifications, depending on whether you wish to book an event,
      send a question, or ask about interviews, etc. While the fullscreen slideshow effect is more visually pleasing, I would also
      make a grid option available for the photo gallery, so that visitors could view more than one picture at once. If possible,
      I would also link to more past events, so that potential customers could see what has been performed previously. </br>
    </br>
      <img src="images/speakeasy2.png"/>
      <img src="images/speakeasy3.png"/>
            Overall, I think the website is effective in presenting its purpose in a creative and fun way for people to explore.
      It utilizes hierarchy effectively to immediately let the viewer know what the website is for, and makes good use of
      its images and other media to emphasize that.

    <a name="october10"><h2>Building a Website</h2></a>
    <h4>october 10 2016</h4>
     <p>The whole process went relatively smoothly, and helped me arrive at a better understanding of building a website. Even though
       we were copying a code, it was still necessary to keep refreshing, checking, and making adjustments. I found difficulties
       with the following:</br></br>

       	» Adjusting to typing code from the outside in</br>
       	» Adding the internal page -- initially, I did not realize that all you needed to do was copy the HTML code from the original
         page then make adjustments</br>
       	» Linking the home page to the banner -- Since we copied the code, I did not realize that we had to change the link to
         coffeeshop.html on both the home page and the roasters.html page in order for it to work</br>
       » Fixing the navigation’s alignment when the margins and padding were incorrect</br>
     </br>
	   On the other hand, having had experience with CSS before, I found it easy and somewhat exciting to follow along with the CSS
  and make the website appear the way it was intended to. It was interesting to get familiar with coding once again and
  learn about the purpose behind some coding that I had seen before, but did not know the meaning of, such as display:block,
  and the float properties.</br></br>
	   In the future, I would like to go over everything more carefully, and attempt to write my own code. Although it
  was good practice to follow along with building a website from someone else’s code, next time, I would like to see
  how much I can remember and what I am capable of doing on my own.
